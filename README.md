THIS IS A GOFUNDME LANDING PAGE DESIGN CALLED gofundKIDS SOLELY FOR KIDS

Welcome to gofundKIDS, a compassionate landing page designed solely to help children in need. This project represents 
the initial step in creating a platform to bring hope, support, and lasting change to vulnerable kids by raising 
awareness for their education, healthcare, shelter, and nutrition.

Create Your Fundraiser
Start your journey to make a difference by creating your own fundraiser. Share your story, set your goals, 
and inspire others to support your cause. Whether you’re helping a community, supporting a loved one, or 
championing a personal mission, this is your platform to bring positive change.

Reach Donors with Social Apps
Easily share your fundraiser on social platforms to connect with donors and grow your support. Spread your story, 
engage others, and inspire giving through simple, effective sharing.

Receipt of Funds
Securely receive and track your donations with ease.

While this is currently only a landing page design, my goal is to build a full platform that empowers donors and fundraisers to make a meaningful impact. Join us in envisioning a kinder future where every child has access to education, hospital care, safe shelter, and nourishing meals.
